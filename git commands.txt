// Git commands 

git clone // to copy the contents from GitHub to the local - usually followed by the clone link - ex: git clone https://github.com/Mani-1703/demo-repo.git
git status // to check the status of the file - whether it has been linked or not 
git add . ( to add all) 
git commit -m "" -m""       // first -m to commit change title and second -m to commit change description
git push // to send any changes from local to GitHub 
git push origin main // origin is our actual github's repo ( using gitclone we copied that repo) (main signifies that the change has to be made on the main branch)

you just Insert - Add - commit and Push - in general to make changes 





cd <folder/repo name> // to move to that directory / folder - the directory is new or 1st time
cd ../<folder/repo name> // if thats a second time generated repo and we want to go to it 
git init // to add this second repo to the github 
git remote add origin <link of the new reference repo> // adding a local repo to a reference repo in github 
git remote -v // checking the status of the remote 

git push -u origin main // if we dont want to write origin main every single time - we use -u means an upstream which signifies that we want to push it to that location - in our case it is the orign main 
so next time we can just use git push 

// a small revision 
// git pull // to pull the changes from github to the local 
// git branch -M <main/master> // when the name of the repo is changed from main to master or vice versa - use this command to change the name
